# ── Build the self-hosted Minecraft web client (zardoy/minecraft-web-client) ──
# Clones the upstream repo at its LATEST RELEASE TAG (v2.3.0 — verified against
# the GitHub releases page on 2026-09-09; the `next` branch is the project's
# live dev branch, "usually newer, but might be less stable", and its moving
# head made Docker images non-reproducible) into web-client/src and runs its
# production build into web-client/dist, which bot.js serves on its own local
# port for the dashboard's /play tab. Re-runs check out the tag again and
# rebuild. Override the tag with MC_WEB_CLIENT_TAG if you ever need a
# different upstream version.
#
# Before building, scripts/patch-web-client-enchants.js applies these source
# patches to the upstream client:
# 1. prismarine-item's `enchants` getter (on 1.20.5+ servers it returns the raw
#    component object instead of an array and throws on unknown versions, which
#    crashes mineflayer's digTime with "(enchantments ?? []) is not iterable"
#    — so the browser client could never break blocks while holding an
#    enchanted item). The patch normalizes the getter.
# 2. makeOptimizedMcData.mjs so the build-time mc-data prep loads only the
#    current 1.21.x generation (1.21 → latest, ~10 versions) by default
#    instead of every version (1.8 → 1.21.11): a fresh build peaks at
#    ~2.3 GB RSS with the full corpus vs ~1.8 GB with the 1.21.x range (both
#    measured). Going stricter than 1.21.x would break connecting to other
#    server versions. Patching the source means even a manual `pnpm run build`
#    inside web-client/src is clipped.
# 3. src/index.ts — Velocity /server transfers (the 1.20.5+ Transfer packet):
#    reconnect to the transfer destination through the same proxy.
# 4. src/resourcePack.ts — resource pack downloads fall back to the same-origin
#    /resource-pack-proxy served by web-client.js when the direct browser fetch
#    fails (GitHub redirects carry no CORS headers).
# 5. src/mineflayer/mc-protocol.ts — mid-session reconfigure fix (mirrors
#    bot.js): pause physics while the server holds the client in the
#    'configuration' state (/server switches) so Velocity doesn't kick with
#    "Internal Exception: io.netty...".
# All are covered by test/web-client-enchants.test.js.
#
# Usage:
#   npm run web-client:build                  (all phases; local rebuilds)
#   bash ./scripts/build-web-client.sh prepare  (Docker phase 1: clone + deps)
#   bash ./scripts/build-web-client.sh build    (Docker phase 2: patch + build)
# The Dockerfile splits the two phases into separate RUN steps so the heavy
# pnpm install layer is cached independently — script/patch tweaks then only
# re-run the cheap build phase instead of re-downloading ~1,600 packages
# (which fills small Docker VMs: "ENOSPC: no space left on device").

# by default — no env vars needed. These exports are belt-and-braces (they
# apply even if the source patch fails to land) and let you override the
# range, e.g.:
#   MIN_MC_VERSION=1.21.11 MAX_MC_VERSION=1.21.11 → exactly 1.21.11 (only if
#                                                    ALL your servers are that

#   MIN_MC_VERSION= MAX_MC_VERSION=               → full corpus (every version)
# A range narrower than the 1.21.x generation breaks connecting to servers
# outside it — the client silently falls back to the base version's protocol
# data when a version is absent from the blob (restoreData never throws).
# Equal min/max values mean EXACTLY that version (verified against the real
# minecraft-data version list).
